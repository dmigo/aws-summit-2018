# AWS ML & AI Deep Dive
*Julien Simon*

## Introduction
### Datasets:
 - Training
 - Validation
 - Test

### Advices
 - Be careful with stohastic descend
 - Don't overfit, keep track of your validataion accuracy


## Convolutional Neural Networks
Run multiple convolutions in a row to create filters.

### Workflow
 - convolution
 - subsampling
 - flatten
 - classify

### Applications
 - Image Recognition
 - Face Recognition
 - Real-Time Pose Estimation

## Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
Good for time-series. Operates on LSTM neurons, that keep memory of the previous predictions.

### Applications
 - Translations
 - Stocks

## GAN Generative ?Adaptive? Networks
Generates something like training sample.


## Let's write some code section

[**Apache MXNet**](https://mxnet.apache.org/)
[**Gluon API**](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/data.html)
[**Gluon CV**](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv)
[**Model Server for Apache MXNet**](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-model-server-for-apache-mxnet/)
[**Keras MXNet**](https://pypi.org/project/keras-mxnet/)

## Resumee
A good, high quality lecture. Introduction to the topic, no going too much into tech details, yet describing all the important points.
